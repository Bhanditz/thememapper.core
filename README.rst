ThemeMapper for Diazo
=====

This is a theme editor for Diazo. This theme editor differs from the one found in Plone; it is a stand-alone application. It does require Diazo to apply the XML ofc!

It is still a work in progress. No file browser, no support for external webpages / themes. If something works; awesome. If it doesn't; too bad.

Installation
=====

To install of GitHub:: 

    $ pip install -e git+git://github.com/C4RoCKeT/thememapper.core.git#egg=thememapper.core

thememapper.diazo
=====

If you want to test your mapped theme and you don't have your own Diazo instance running you can install thememapper.diazo.
thememapper.diazo Is like thememapper.core a stand-alone application and does not require thememapper.core to run. For more information please refer to the
readme of thememapper.diazo.
