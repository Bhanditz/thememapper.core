Description: ThemeMapper for Diazo
        =====
        
        This is a theme editor for Diazo. This theme editor differs from the one found in Plone; it is a stand-alone theme editor. It does require Diazo of course!
        
        It is still a work in progress. No file browser, no support for external webpages / themes. If something works; awesome. If it doesn't; to bad.
        
        Quickstart
        =====
        
        I presume there is already a Diazo instance running. If not, go to http://docs.diazo.org/en/latest/quickstart.html for a quickstart.
        
        When you (already) have your Diazo instance up and running navigate to the root of ThemeMapper.
        Now edit the "paste_config_path" variable found in /thememapper/config.py::
        
            paste_config_path = "/path/to/paste/config.ini" # the Diazo paste config. "proxy.ini" if you followed the quickstart
        
        Before running Thememapper you must also have Flask and libcurl installed.
        
        http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/
        
        And
        
        https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycurl
        
        Once you have those installed, navigate to the root of ThemeMapper and execute the following command to start it.
        
            $ python thememapper/thememapper.py
        
        Alternatively you can start the server by calling
        
            $ python thememapper/thememapper.py --port 5001 --config "/path/to/paste/config.ini"
        
        ThemeMapper will read your paste config and use the values found in there.
        It will use:: 
        
            [filter:theme]
            rules = /path/to/themes/directory/basic/rules.xml
        
            [app:content]
            address = http://localhost/
        
        The rules path will be used for the rules.xml, but it will be also used for the theme directory (strips rules.xml).
        The address will be the content url. You could use an external address here, but I don't give a guarantee it will work.
        
        Theme requirements
        =====
        
        There aren't many requirements, technically just one. Namely: your rules.xml for that specific theme should be in the root of the theme directory.
        So for example your theme is named "basic". The location of your rules.xml file would be:
        
            "/path/to/themes/directory/basic/rules.xml"
